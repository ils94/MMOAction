# MMOAction
This tiny program tries to simulate an action camera on MMOs. So instead of holding your right mouse button to move your camera and your character, this tool will do it for you!

# How to use

Hold SHIFT + ALT to lock your right mouse button into action camera.

Hold SHIFT + CTRL to release your right mouse button from action camera.

Holding SHIFT while the right mouse button is locked into action camera, will release it so you can interact with NPCs and objects in game. Releasing SHIFT will lock your mouse back into action camera.

Hold SHIFT + ESC to kill the program and release your mouse.
