# MMOAction
This tiny program tries to simulate an action camera on MMOs. So instead of holding your right mouse button to move your camera and your character, this tool will do it for you!

# How to use

Press SHIFT + ALT to lock your right mouse button into action camera.

Pressing the right mouse button while it locked, will release it. You will have to press SHIFT + ALT again to lock it back into action camera.

Press SHIFT + ALT + CTRL to kill the script.

You can change the above hotkeys by closing MMOAction, and adding your own set of hotkeys in the "hotkeys.txt" file inside the root folder.

Read the instructions below:

You do not add "[]" into the file, they are here just to make the example better to understand.

[a,esc] <- Changes the default "Action Camera Mode" hotkey to "a", and changes the default hotkey to kill the script to "esc".

[,esc] <- Keep the default "Action Camera Mode" hotkey, and changes the default hotkey to kill script to "esc".

[a,] <- Changes the default "Action Camera Mode" hotkey to "a", and keep the default hotkey to kill the script.
