# MMOAction
This tiny program tries to simulate an action camera on MMOs. So instead of holding your right mouse button to move your camera and your character, this tool will do it for you!

# How to use

Press SHIFT + ALT to lock your right mouse button into action camera.

Pressing the right mouse button while it locked, will release it. You will have to press SHIFT + ALT again to lock it back into action camera.

Press SHIFT + ALT + CTRL to kill the script.
